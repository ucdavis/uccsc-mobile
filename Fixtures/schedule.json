      "description": "Are you being asked to do more with less? We are. IT is often expected to perform magic by automating business processes, but that fails miserably when the process is cumbersome to begin with! Here at UC San Diego, we are committed to success by making our business processes sustainable and growing a continuous improvement mindset.\n\nYet finding ways to inspire, make connections and raise practice across campus is challenging. Which is why we held UC San Diego’s Process Palooza. An integrated experience, this first-of-its-kind conference and competition showcased the practice and benefits of process improvement using Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodology in a fun, interactive and highly engaging way.\n\nOpen to the entire UC community (students, faculty, researchers, staff) and extension alumni, Process Palooza is now one of the ways we are changing our campus culture by bringing together non-practitioners and practitioners alike to share, learn, compete and network!\n\nAt Process Palooza Dr. Elizabeth Simmons, UC San Diego’s new executive vice chancellor for academic affairs and particle physicist, likened her field with that of process improvement because both require observation and inquiry into why things happen the way they do. She said it is critical to ask questions about how and why things are done a certain way to encourage innovation and improvement. Event participants shared their LSS experiences, measureable impact, challenges and success while competitors raced against the clock using LSS to improve real business UC San Diego processes.  More than 400 attendees learned to incorporate process improvement into their jobs, and saw first-hand how process improvement can save money, streamline operations and improve service.\n\nCome and learn about Process Palooza- how we break down barriers to participation, engage communities of practice, bring campus leaders onboard, build meaningful partnerships and how we are packaging it for others!",

This session will cover how we set up a staging server with half a petabyte of capacity to capture research data and assist researchers and curators to collaborate on a shared platform. After working with over 20 different researchers and labs, it became perfectly clear that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution.

Developers had to be confident in every change,  and **users needed to be confident in every release**. This meant building code on well tested foundations, choosing technologies that favored stable releases over breaking changes, and adopting a culture of **agile project management** an**d test driven development**.\n\nIn 2017 we averaged a **deploy every other week**! When it is necessary we can get bug fixes out to our users in minutes and we are so confident in each release that  we usually deploy our changes **on Friday nights**.\n\nThis talk will cover the practical tools and technologies we use, but more importantly, I will discus the mechanisms from **code review** to **project planning** that allow us to keep our team's velocity so high.",

This talk will present examples on how to ease the strain of interacting with end users and provide insight on how to bridge the communication gap between the IT professional and they people they support. The skills used to communicate with the end user, in all IT career fields, are notoriously lacking.\n\nFor many IT professionals, the so-called “soft skills” required to have successful interactions with end users are non-existent. Users become dissatisfied and unwilling to adopt change, while the IT professional struggles to maintain policy. The solution to help bolster these trying interactions is by emphasizing the use of the three Cs: courtesy, clarity, and comprehension.\n\nIt has been observed that when engaged, user satisfaction and willingness to comply increases greatly and allows success for the IT professional to accomplish their goals. One interesting parallel that supports this claim can be seen through the relationships forged through a medical doctor’s communication skills with their patients. Studies have shown that when doctor-patient communications increased a more positive outcome occurred especially in the areas of adherence and compliance (Matusitz & Spear, 2014).\n\nThis talk takes a deeper dive into these meanings and provides useful, applicable tips on how an IT professional can apply them.  In order for an IT professional to be successful in their own jobs, they must master the three Cs when interacting with the end user.\n\nMatusitz, J., & Spear, J.

If they were lucky. Some campuses had more than one. Most campuses had a dozen other web solutions too. This was indeed the Wild West of Web platforms.\n\nSome of us realized that with the release of Drupal 8, we have an opportunity to join forces and collaborate on building the best Drupal distribution for Higher Education.\n\nSo UCSF, UCLA, and UC Davis joined forces and, well, we did it. And it's called SiteFarm.\n\nBecause of this effort, we stand to realize significant security, stability, accessibility, and consistency gains across all campuses.

Upon request, staff will search the database and provide a list of referrals to students. Upcoming enhancements will open access to this application directly to the community.\n\nDiscussion points of the session will include why certain design elements were chosen. For example, why are their 200+ fields in the provider application? The application is utilized by four separate units. Each unit has a different population which they serve. As a result, they require different information about each provider. In order for the database to be useful to all of the units, consensus was made on a dataset of 200+ fields. As a result, this many fields led to a very long form. We’ll discuss how the form was shortened to about 10 minutes with conditional fields and autocompletion.\n\nDesign elements were also based on UC Irvine’s unique surrounding area. However, the application can easily be modified for other campuses. As an example, Mental Health Professionals in South Orange County do not have a heavy dependence on referrals from the university. Therefore, it can be difficult to get service providers to continually update their data. In order to keep the information as current as possible, the application will allow staff to edit provider information directly. Additionally, automatic emails are sent reminding service providers to update their information and licensure status.\n\nOther topics for the session include separating moderation by each unit, notes, search (with maps), mobile accessibility, printing, and exposing this data as a feed.",

      "title": "\"I, For One, Welcome Our New Robot Permissions Overlords\"",
      "description": "When crafting access models for content management applications, there are two interconnected standard models: that of role assignment, and that of permissions assignment. Typically, a modern application will have customized roles (\"admin\", \"approver\") which are in turn fine tuned by the addition/exclusion of specific permitted actions (\"can update forms\", \"can delete users\"). These roles are in turn assigned by managers to users of the application, explicitly, giving them access in proportion to their needs.\n\nThis model is hampered by a few key issues: first, roles must be explicitly assigned and determined by a third party. Next, those roles may not be flexible enough to control or constrain exceptional use cases like limited time engagement, heightened privilege for specific use, or rapidly shifting organizational roles for a user. Still, it continues to be the primary model for use because in large part, it mostly works.\n\nIn education and curriculum management, we face some particularly thorny issues like those noted above, which complicate the ability to easily provide appropriate access to curricular content within our management platforms: short-term or even one-time instructors; teaching assistants, peer mentors, and small group discussion leads; work-study students, and more. In these cases, it can be challenging to provide a simple and manageable permissions control environment without either significant compromise in the levels of access granted, or the resource needs to oversee their maintenance, or both.\n\nWith the new permissions model being deployed in the Ilios curriculum management platform, we have taken a different, hybrid approach: rather than relying on roles assigned for access to data, _we are determining permissions based on relationship to the data itself._ A user associated with a dataset will be provided with a role via the context of their data relationship, allowing the process to be derivative from the internal interaction of user, data, and context. The permissions matrix (and in turn, the default \"roles\") is then produced via a canvassing of all the standard permutations of user interaction.\n\nIn this presentation, we will discuss how this model reduces resource overhead for management, since it relies explicitly on published data context, rather than external role assignment; how it also reduces risk, since overly-permissive (or restrictive) roles need not be applied; we will show how the algorithmic intelligence of the data itself provides the baseline foundations for user management. We will share the conceptual planning which helped to develop this model, and show the applied matrix which is governing data access in the platform.",

      "description": "Higher education needs to graduate students on time. Some benefits include: decreasing the student's cost of education and more space for new students.   \n  \nTo achieve this, one component includes helping students understand what their schedules might look like for the degree they are considering. Another component is giving academic staff visibility on course demand so they can plan appropriately.  \nOffering 30 class seats when the demand is 90 in a required course leads to delayed graduation. Providing students with an easy to use planner to map their academic career empowers them to view realistic scenarios of graduating with a specific degree. Allowing students to easily see what it takes to have an emphasis, concentration or a minor without having to meet with an undergraduate/graduate advisor. The rules for degree requirements, the prerequisites of courses, the availability of classes in a student's schedule is complicated. This is not an easy problem to solve. Our campus is about five years out from integrating a schedule planning solution. At UC Santa Barbara, Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, we developed a custom, easy to use schedule planner for our Master's Program called Myplan. Myplan allows creating multiple scenarios, trying out different emphasis, concentrations and specializations with an automated requirement check. This has enabled our Student Affairs staff to only review schedule submissions that have exceptions. Students can now easily update their planned schedule when they decide to change courses during their academic career. Empowering students to create and visualize a schedule meeting the requirements of their degree should be a requirement of our higher education institutions.",

A change to your data is instantly accessible on the web.  No Duplicate copies!\n\nDuring this session, I'll demo some key use cases and lessons learned in our staff learning and adopting this technology.   I'll also demonstrate how we easily created reports/graphs and charts using Airtable by synchronizing data in a legacy web application to a \"base\" in Airtable.   One use cases will include efficient on-boarding of visitors and having a live calendar view of when visitors arrive and depart.\n\nI'll also summarize the key missing features gathered from the active community forum  on Airtable.",

Subsequently, and after repeated escalations to management, she would initiate one of the largest investigations in University history and prove a hostile work environment based on gender.\n\nThis is her story coming forward and breaking the silence on a systemic culture of abuse and retaliation. She will reference the completed University investigation and present why it was imperative, in her opinion, to shed light on the University's behavior to discredit the voices of women who were harassed in IT at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe presentation will review the numerous supporting documents supplied to initiate the investigation. The necessary role of allies in creating an irrefutable case. The role of “bad players” in ignoring or blocking requests for help. The coordinated efforts of the respondents to corroborate and change facts. The retaliation that she experienced while the investigation was underway. The role of IT’s HR in protecting the University and, per the investigation, knowingly falsifying information to justify the departure of woman after woman on the team.\n\nThe presentation will address the stigmas around credibility when one does come forward and the prevailing fear that prevents others from supporting or coming forward. How power is doled out to the “trusted” who play ball, as the people in power want it to be played.\n\nFurthermore, the presentation will describe the events immediately post\u00adinvestigation: Vanessa was terminated. She sent numerous detailed email documents to the CIO of the University of California, Berkeley detailing retaliation and witness intimidation, the CIO refused in email to meet with Vanessa.\n\nThe presentation will discuss University and Nondiscrimination in Employment policy violations and examine why zero tolerance is not effectively observed or enforced among staff in IT at the University of California, Berkeley. As a woman of color, in an industry severely underrepresented by women of color, Vanessa will describe the profile for leadership in IT at the University of California, Berkeley and the promotion patterns and opportunities open only to that profile.\n\nIn addition, time will be spent describing the various paths that could have been followed \u00ad including a settlement \u00ad and what each of those would have looked like in Vanessa’s opinion.\n\nFinally, ample time will be allocated to an explanation, in her own words, on why Vanessa would not stand down to the systemic harassment and discrimination that she and multiple women experienced. The presentation will discuss the long term advantages to shedding light on discriminatory work environments and how to be prepared to do so to protect future women.",
