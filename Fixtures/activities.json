The panel will highlight recommendations for pragmatic actions to ensure UC supports and promotes women in IT. A working group will be formed to follow up on some of the ideas raised in this session and build an empowering work environment for UC women in IT. The panel will be followed by another WIT session: Empowering Women: From History to Practical Change.\n\nLunch will be provided in lobby outside the Vanderhoef Studio for up to 60 attendees as part of the session. The form provides an opportunity to submit questions for panelists in advance; submitters’ names will be kept anonymous. Confirmation of registration will be sent to attendees closer to the event.",
