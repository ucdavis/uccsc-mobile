        "description": "Are you being asked to do more with less? We are. IT is often expected to perform magic by automating business processes, but that fails miserably when the process is cumbersome to begin with! Here at UC San Diego, we are committed to success by making our business processes sustainable and growing a continuous improvement mindset.\n\nYet finding ways to inspire, make connections and raise practice across campus is challenging. Which is why we held UC San Diego’s Process Palooza. An integrated experience, this first-of-its-kind conference and competition showcased the practice and benefits of process improvement using Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodology in a fun, interactive and highly engaging way.\n\nOpen to the entire UC community (students, faculty, researchers, staff) and extension alumni, Process Palooza is now one of the ways we are changing our campus culture by bringing together non-practitioners and practitioners alike to share, learn, compete and network!\n\nAt Process Palooza Dr. Elizabeth Simmons, UC San Diego’s new executive vice chancellor for academic affairs and particle physicist, likened her field with that of process improvement because both require observation and inquiry into why things happen the way they do. She said it is critical to ask questions about how and why things are done a certain way to encourage innovation and improvement. Event participants shared their LSS experiences, measureable impact, challenges and success while competitors raced against the clock using LSS to improve real business UC San Diego processes.  More than 400 attendees learned to incorporate process improvement into their jobs, and saw first-hand how process improvement can save money, streamline operations and improve service.\n\nCome and learn about Process Palooza- how we break down barriers to participation, engage communities of practice, bring campus leaders onboard, build meaningful partnerships and how we are packaging it for others!",

How do you bridge the gap between becoming a dumping ground for unstructured raw data and the place where you can collaborate with a research group to curate and distribute their data in our Digital Asset Management System? This session will cover how we set up a staging server with half a petabyte of capacity to capture research data and assist researchers and curators to collaborate on a shared platform. After working with over 20 different researchers and labs, it became perfectly clear that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution.

        "description": "When we set out to re-write Ilios in 2014 the most important metric we targeted with every decision was confidence. Developers had to be confident in every change,  and **users needed to be confident in every release**. This meant building code on well tested foundations, choosing technologies that favored stable releases over breaking changes, and adopting a culture of **agile project management** an**d test driven development**.\n\nIn 2017 we averaged a **deploy every other week**! When it is necessary we can get bug fixes out to our users in minutes and we are so confident in each release that  we usually deploy our changes **on Friday nights**.\n\nThis talk will cover the practical tools and technologies we use, but more importantly, I will discus the mechanisms from **code review** to **project planning** that allow us to keep our team's velocity so high.\n\n**Slides:** [https://jrjohnson.github.io/talks/2018-08-stuck-to-soaring-uccsc.html](https://jrjohnson.github.io/talks/2018-08-stuck-to-soaring-uccsc.html)",

        "description": "All too often, we select technologies based on their abstract capabilities and feature sets -- or worse, on their ability to fit in a budget -- rather than on their strategic appropriateness for a school's mission and culture. This is an unavoidable consequence of the world we work in. Sadly, it all too often can lead to the mis-application, misuse, and in the end the underutilization of a technology or set of tools, and a loss of value, resource, and effort. \n\nBut wait! All is not lost!\n\nRemediating this problem is possible by applying the practice of effective professional development for your teams, appropriate identification of skills and strengths in your people, and cultivating and managing those people in conjunction with the technologies and tools they must support. Even the least appropriate tool can be salvaged for beneficial practical use when serviced by highly functioning and well-supported people. And when it cannot, if your people are well supported and trained, and given the sense of autonomy and security necessary, they will be able to present the gaps and needs they see, and help support a positive argument for technological change.\n\nIn this session we will look at some of the ways to attract, train, and hold on to excellent team members. We will discuss real world examples of puzzling together some of the challenges of identifying and nurturing true skill sets, assigning (and reassigning) individuals within a team to play to their strengths, and discuss how the human factor in the infrastructure and architecture of educational technology is the most significant, and under-represented, equation in the overall algorithm of strategic success for a technology practice.\n\n_NOTE: Pairs well with Jon Johnson's \\[jrjohnson (4032)\\] proposal titled \"From Stuck to Soaring\"_",

        "description": "User interaction is fundamental to successful IT operations within an organization. A disconnect between the end user point of view and the IT professional is growing. This talk will present examples on how to ease the strain of interacting with end users and provide insight on how to bridge the communication gap between the IT professional and they people they support. The skills used to communicate with the end user, in all IT career fields, are notoriously lacking.\n\nFor many IT professionals, the so-called “soft skills” required to have successful interactions with end users are non-existent. Users become dissatisfied and unwilling to adopt change, while the IT professional struggles to maintain policy. The solution to help bolster these trying interactions is by emphasizing the use of the three Cs: courtesy, clarity, and comprehension.\n\nIt has been observed that when engaged, user satisfaction and willingness to comply increases greatly and allows success for the IT professional to accomplish their goals. One interesting parallel that supports this claim can be seen through the relationships forged through a medical doctor’s communication skills with their patients. Studies have shown that when doctor-patient communications increased a more positive outcome occurred especially in the areas of adherence and compliance (Matusitz & Spear, 2014).\n\nThis talk takes a deeper dive into these meanings and provides useful, applicable tips on how an IT professional can apply them.  In order for an IT professional to be successful in their own jobs, they must master the three Cs when interacting with the end user.\n\nMatusitz, J., & Spear, J.

If they were lucky. Some campuses had more than one. Most campuses had a dozen other web solutions too. This was indeed the Wild West of Web platforms.\n\nSome of us realized that with the release of Drupal 8, we have an opportunity to join forces and collaborate on building the best Drupal distribution for Higher Education.\n\nSo UCSF, UCLA, and UC Davis joined forces and, well, we did it. And it's called SiteFarm.\n\nBecause of this effort, we stand to realize significant security, stability, accessibility, and consistency gains across all campuses. Not to mention, reducing duplication of work. So much duplication of work...\n\nIn this session, we'll cover:\n\n*   Identifying the problem\n*   Building a grassroots collaboration\n*   Establishing governance\n*   Development\n*   Automated testing\n*   Evangelism\n*   Success!\n*   Future plans",

Upon request, staff will search the database and provide a list of referrals to students. Upcoming enhancements will open access to this application directly to the community.\n\nDiscussion points of the session will include why certain design elements were chosen. For example, why are their 200+ fields in the provider application? The application is utilized by four separate units. Each unit has a different population which they serve. As a result, they require different information about each provider. In order for the database to be useful to all of the units, consensus was made on a dataset of 200+ fields. As a result, this many fields led to a very long form. We’ll discuss how the form was shortened to about 10 minutes with conditional fields and autocompletion.\n\nDesign elements were also based on UC Irvine’s unique surrounding area. However, the application can easily be modified for other campuses. As an example, Mental Health Professionals in South Orange County do not have a heavy dependence on referrals from the university. Therefore, it can be difficult to get service providers to continually update their data. In order to keep the information as current as possible, the application will allow staff to edit provider information directly. Additionally, automatic emails are sent reminding service providers to update their information and licensure status.\n\nOther topics for the session include separating moderation by each unit, notes, search (with maps), mobile accessibility, printing, and exposing this data as a feed.",

In this presentation we will explore how business analysis, advisor interviews, and user experience design were employed to bring about student data reporting tools that met the real needs of campus advising units.\n\nIn partnership, our central IT organization works collaboratively with advisors to ensure that intervention and outreach occur with reduced manual processes, greater flexibility in data access, and easy to use filters to target specific populations rapidly. Advisors spend less time wrangling spreadsheets and more time working with students.\n\nThis presentation will cover the background of the Compass project, including its origins in the University of California, Irvine’s earlier student success initiatives. We’ll also provide a look into the reports that have been created for our academic advisors, including ways to look at bulk student data in ways not previously feasible in existing reports.",

        "title": "\"I, For One, Welcome Our New Robot Permissions Overlords\"",
        "description": "When crafting access models for content management applications, there are two interconnected standard models: that of role assignment, and that of permissions assignment. Typically, a modern application will have customized roles (\"admin\", \"approver\") which are in turn fine tuned by the addition/exclusion of specific permitted actions (\"can update forms\", \"can delete users\"). These roles are in turn assigned by managers to users of the application, explicitly, giving them access in proportion to their needs.\n\nThis model is hampered by a few key issues: first, roles must be explicitly assigned and determined by a third party. Next, those roles may not be flexible enough to control or constrain exceptional use cases like limited time engagement, heightened privilege for specific use, or rapidly shifting organizational roles for a user. Still, it continues to be the primary model for use because in large part, it mostly works.\n\nIn education and curriculum management, we face some particularly thorny issues like those noted above, which complicate the ability to easily provide appropriate access to curricular content within our management platforms: short-term or even one-time instructors; teaching assistants, peer mentors, and small group discussion leads; work-study students, and more. In these cases, it can be challenging to provide a simple and manageable permissions control environment without either significant compromise in the levels of access granted, or the resource needs to oversee their maintenance, or both.\n\nWith the new permissions model being deployed in the Ilios curriculum management platform, we have taken a different, hybrid approach: rather than relying on roles assigned for access to data, _we are determining permissions based on relationship to the data itself._ A user associated with a dataset will be provided with a role via the context of their data relationship, allowing the process to be derivative from the internal interaction of user, data, and context. The permissions matrix (and in turn, the default \"roles\") is then produced via a canvassing of all the standard permutations of user interaction.\n\nIn this presentation, we will discuss how this model reduces resource overhead for management, since it relies explicitly on published data context, rather than external role assignment; how it also reduces risk, since overly-permissive (or restrictive) roles need not be applied; we will show how the algorithmic intelligence of the data itself provides the baseline foundations for user management. We will share the conceptual planning which helped to develop this model, and show the applied matrix which is governing data access in the platform.",

        "description": "Higher education needs to graduate students on time. Some benefits include: decreasing the student's cost of education and more space for new students.   \n  \nTo achieve this, one component includes helping students understand what their schedules might look like for the degree they are considering. Another component is giving academic staff visibility on course demand so they can plan appropriately.  \nOffering 30 class seats when the demand is 90 in a required course leads to delayed graduation. Providing students with an easy to use planner to map their academic career empowers them to view realistic scenarios of graduating with a specific degree. Allowing students to easily see what it takes to have an emphasis, concentration or a minor without having to meet with an undergraduate/graduate advisor. The rules for degree requirements, the prerequisites of courses, the availability of classes in a student's schedule is complicated. This is not an easy problem to solve. Our campus is about five years out from integrating a schedule planning solution. At UC Santa Barbara, Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, we developed a custom, easy to use schedule planner for our Master's Program called Myplan. Myplan allows creating multiple scenarios, trying out different emphasis, concentrations and specializations with an automated requirement check. This has enabled our Student Affairs staff to only review schedule submissions that have exceptions. Students can now easily update their planned schedule when they decide to change courses during their academic career. Empowering students to create and visualize a schedule meeting the requirements of their degree should be a requirement of our higher education institutions.",

A change to your data is instantly accessible on the web.  No Duplicate copies!\n\nDuring this session, I'll demo some key use cases and lessons learned in our staff learning and adopting this technology.   I'll also demonstrate how we easily created reports/graphs and charts using Airtable by synchronizing data in a legacy web application to a \"base\" in Airtable.   One use cases will include efficient on-boarding of visitors and having a live calendar view of when visitors arrive and depart.\n\nI'll also summarize the key missing features gathered from the active community forum  on Airtable.",

        "description": "Let's say that your pool of licenses won't stretch across your fleet. Let's say that the vendor requires a username and password for each seat. How do you handle the provisioning of vendor specific accounts? How can you keep track of who needs software and who suddenly no longer does? Let's face it, serialized software could soon become a thing of the past.  \nConfiguration management tools hold the answers to these questions. You have OU’s, Smart Groups, Relevance, tools that allow IT to automatically scope software according to policy. There are times, however, when these tools fall short of what we need from them.  \nWhere are the buttons that integrate with vendor account provisioning systems? Where are the smart computer groups that update according to metadata mined from web services instead of local attributes?  \nCirrup and Mudwork are two such tools for filling the gap above. Cirrup manages groups of computers based off of the attributes of the unique person id’s that they are assigned to. Mudwork provisions Adobe Federated ID’s and manages Adobe Named User License entitlements. Together, these tools form a system that automatically manages entitlements and revokes unused software licenses.",

        "description": "In 2014, Vanessa Kaskiris joined a team in IT at the University of California, Berkeley. Subsequently, and after repeated escalations to management, she would initiate one of the largest investigations in University history and prove a hostile work environment based on gender.\n\nThis is her story coming forward and breaking the silence on a systemic culture of abuse and retaliation. She will reference the completed University investigation and present why it was imperative to shed light on the University's behavior to discredit the voices of women who were harassed in IT at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe presentation will review the numerous supporting documents supplied to initiate the investigation. The necessary role of allies in creating an irrefutable case. The retaliation that she experienced while the investigation was underway. The role of IT’s HR to, per the investigation, knowingly falsify information to justify the departure of woman after woman on the team.\n\nThe presentation will address the stigmas around credibility when one does come forward and the prevailing fear that prevents others from supporting or coming forward. Furthermore, the presentation will describe the events immediately post\u00ad investigation: Vanessa was terminated. She sent numerous detailed email documents to the CIO of the University of California, Berkeley detailing retaliation and witness intimidation, the CIO refused in email to meet with Vanessa.\n\nThe presentation will discuss University and Nondiscrimination in Employment policy violations and examine why zero tolerance is not effectively observed or enforced among staff in IT at the University of California, Berkeley. As a woman of color, in an industry severely underrepresented by women of color, Vanessa will describe the promotion patterns for leadership in IT at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIn addition, time will be spent describing the various paths that could have been followed, including a settlement, and what each of those would have looked like in Vanessa’s opinion.\n\nFinally, ample time will be allocated to an explanation, in her own words, on why Vanessa would not stand down to the systemic harassment and discrimination that she and multiple women experienced. The presentation will discuss the long term advantages to shedding light on discriminatory work environments and how to be prepared to do so to protect future women.",

        "title": "Patient Consent and Written Authorization Forms: Redundant in the world of OAuth2?",
        "description": "As healthcare providers open up patient access to their digital health records, it presents scenarios where patients use mobile apps to “pull” their health records from different providers in one place, or direct a provider to send their data to another provider. However, before such pulling or sharing can begin, a provider may need an explicit patient consent or authorization form (often paper-based) signed by the patient. Today, a patient would typically do this by signing a paper form and the provider would hand over a DVD containing scanned PDF copies of the patient’s health records. Now, imagine using a consumer health app on your phone, and every time you request your provider to share your records, the app asks you to first download a consent form that you then need to print, sign and fax to your provider. That would be a cumbersome and undesirable patient experience. Instead, digitally embedding patient consent during the electronic pulling or sharing of patient records itself can make this experience much smoother. Interestingly, one can implement this workflow with OAuth2, an industry-standard protocol for authorization. This session presents different implementation approaches for this based on my observations from the Consumer-Centered Data Exchange (CCDE) track of the last two FHIR Connectathons (September 2017 and February 2018).",

        "description": "The IWE Framework project focuses on facilitating application development across the UCLA campus by providing services and tools available to all developers in order to create consistency throughout applications within the MyUCLA umbrella hassle-free. The MyUCLA web portal houses many applications for virtually every type of campus affiliate, justifying a need for a centralized utility to handle the diversity in functionality and user base. The approach of the IWE Framework project in order to aid in campus-wide MyUCLA development has two main facets: the first being the Menu Data & Layout API (also referred to as just the “Framework”) and the IWE Style Guide web components (also referral to as the “Style Guide”).\n\nFrom the perspective of the “Framework”, our goal was to enable developers to quickly and easily create a web page, using any technology stack, without having to worry about 3 key aspects of the MyUCLA ecosystem: the header, the footer and the complex mega menu. MyUCLA users can immediately recognize MyUCLA web features based on these three elements and are accustomed to using them, thus we deemed it pertinent to create a way for developers to create the MyUCLA layout on their page while only doing minimal groundwork upfront. In short, the API we created allows a developer to quickly and painlessly retrieve the entire basic layout of a MyUCLA feature, including the header, footer and rendering of the MyUCLA mega menu via a custom HTML Element and simple API call.\n\nWhile the Framework deals with MyUCLA branding outside of the main content area, the Style Guide targets the actual content of an application. The IWE Style Guide is a library of plug and play web components built on the Google Polymer Project platform for the consumption of MyUCLA developers in order to create a consistent and coherent look and feel throughout different MyUCLA web features. Ranging from simple text guidelines and link styling to custom HTML inputs, autocompletes, buttons and dropdowns, the Style Guide focuses on creating distributed, reusable components to not only ensure consistent styling and functionality across MyUCLA features but also to incorporate blanketed adherence to modern W3C accessibility standards.\n\nBoth the Framework and Style Guide include all appropriate design and implementation documentation.",

        "description": "Maintaining an enterprise software system is not walk in the park. The system is critical to the daily job of fleets of staff members across over 50 departments on the UCSB campus. As much alluring as 'greenfield development might be, the  'nuke and pave' solution is far too disruptive to be considered a viable option. Instead, the goal is to keep University business going: tracking proposals into grants, budgeting for payroll and other expenses while meeting grant requirements. The technology that presents these tools to the end user should not be apparent to them. Their workflows must support the changing  business processes and every edge case must be considered.\n\nThis presentation will cover how a small team (of less than 2 dedicated FTE) have been able to maintain and enhance a successful software project for the last 18 years. Of greater interest, we will review the past 2 years of this project, which have seen a many infrastructure advancements and future facing prototypes. Archaic, black box technologies have been transparently replaced with testable code written in modern (ubiquitous) programming languages. These new components have seamlessly enhanced the reliability and response time of the application to all users. Prototypes have been built that can leverage Campus Authentication while utilizing Cloud services. These prototypes have provided indispensable insights into the architectural requirements of the next generation of this application. \n\nCome and hear about our lessons learned in maintaining and modernizing a legacy application as we move towards migration to a cloud based solution.",

But we have a problem: the systems and processes that were once state-of-the-art are no longer adequate in supporting our core business functions. We’re not just talking about replacing a single ERP system, which is enough to bring an institution to its knees. We’re talking about transforming all core business systems and administrative processes  across the campus. We’re talking Financial, HR, Research Administration, Student Information Systems, and more!\n\nCall us crazy if you want, but we embrace a tradition of nontradition. We strive to “break things better.” So, we’re breaking all the rules of a typical ERP implementation.\n\nBye bye, 100-page RFPs. Army of consultants? We have the experts right here. Do this in secret and tell everyone later? Uh, no.\n\nWith our Enterprise Systems Renewal (ESR) effort, we’ve created an edgy playbook with topics like Procurement Bake-offs, Expert Sourcing, Lean Process Review, Change Practitioner Network, Activity Hubs, Analytics at Your Fingertips, Everything-as-a-Service, and Hyper-modular Sustainable Architecture. The entire campus is involved, with technologists, central offices and academic departments all working together to optimize processes and to deploy new systems that will effectively meet the ever-changing needs of our growing university. Come hear our incredible story!",

The ONC (Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology) has made it clear that supporting the patient API is the provider’s responsibility.\n\nAPI Meaningful Use Stage 3 requirements:\n\n*   APIs must allow patient access to data categories found in [CCDs](https://corepointhealth.com/resource-center/hl7-resources/ccd) (electronic summary of care document) using the application of their choice.\n*   Information must be returned _meaningfully_, using required data standards in computable format.\n*   APIs must be open and transparent, and publish access instructions, documentation, and terms of use online and on the ONC website.\n*   The ONC has not yet set standards and security measures, but have indicated they intend to require [FHIR](https://corepointhealth.com/fhir) and OAUTH2.\n*   Requirements for APIs are mostly read access.\" *\n\nThe Health Stack project at UCSF CDHI is deployed using an API Proxy Platform that serves-up secure, role-based interoperable data of EPIC's APIs while adhering to FHIR, OAUTH2 and SMART-on-FHIR guidelines.  This session will provide a walk-through of the design and implementation, and demonstrate live-code usage of Patient API access.  Differences among user roles of trusted and untrusted applications calling into these APIs will also be discussed.\n\n*Corepoint Health reference",

PrEP-Rx aims to educate health care providers on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and assist providers in appropriately targeting patients at increased risk for HIV acquisition, initiating PrEP when appropriate, and providing guidance on the ongoing monitoring and adherence counseling of PrEP patients. The research team will give an overview of the research and share their experience working with developers and designers to launch a pilot study at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General HIV Clinic (Ward 86) and eventually roll out the PrEP-Rx tool to other clinics across the San Francisco Department of Public Health. We will discuss tips on how we iterated on this product to achieve actionable and measurable results, and advise on some of the lessons learned throughout the project.",

        "description": "A surprising amount of code essential to academic research is written by postdocs, graduate students, and programming staff on limited grant appointments in research labs.  The process of transitioning ownership of code to a new research programmer is challenging under the best circumstances. Unfortunately, a lack of consistent code versioning practices, build procedures, supporting data, use documentation, integration testing, and outside collaboration often makes this transition considerably more difficult.  By addressing these elements continuously during development, research labs can greatly minimize the expense and delay involved in bringing a new developer up to speed with a code base.  Ideas will be explored by incrementally improving a sample application with the following issues: 1) missing code, 2) missing build processes, 3) missing data, 4) missing documentation, 5) missing tests, and 6) missing collaborators.",

PCSSC is responsible for Workload Automation and Managed File transfers across multi-campus IT organizations, supporting Business Units and Campus for UC San Francisco, UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, UC Office of the President, and the UCPath initiative. In March 2018 I was given leadership of the EOS team, Endpoint Operations Services team. \r\n\r\nMy interests - NCIS, watching my 3 grandsons grow up, being with family, my 2 Cocker Spaniels, and meeting new people. \r\n",

        "description": "The University of California has been contributing to an EDUCAUSE Center for Analysis (ECAR) working group that is examining the ITSM concepts of a “service owner”. A service owner is accountable for the delivery of an IT service and ensures that the service receives strategic attention and appropriate resources to support the mission and needs of the Institution. The service owner is responsible for the service as a whole through its entire lifecycle and is accountable to the person in charge of overall IT service delivery. \n\nThe ECAR working group is writing a paper to provide guidance and best practices on how and when that role can be applied in higher education to improve the IT organization’s IT service management effectiveness. This session will first present the ECAR working group’s results and then follow that with a facilitated panel discussion about how we can apply the concepts, guidelines and practices to the various campuses throughout the University of California system. A panel of Service Owners from UC Davis, UC Riverside, UCLA and UC San Diego who have successfully been applying the ITSM Service Owners roles and responsibilities to their organizations will discuss how they implemented the role, the challenges, and the value of ITSM Service Owner processes overall. Audience members will also have the opportunity to ask follow-up questions of the panel and provide feedback directly to the ECAR working group on their conclusions. \n\nSpecific topics that the session will cover include the definitions of service owner and service-offering manager roles, recommendations for service owner and service-offering manager responsibilities and key activities (grounded in the major phases of the service lifecycle), guidance for selection of staff for these roles and supporting them for success, and key performance indicators.",

        "description": "The thousand decisions your department makes every day can't be directed in your executive offices or planned out by your managers. You need your entire organization to prioritize making every day better than the last.\n\nAt UC Irvine we have been empowering teams to collaborate and share best practices through cross-team forums that bring together like-minded individuals from disparate parts of our organization. Our Web Authors Learning League gets technical, diving into new CSS, new languages, and new techniques. The Agile Forum takes on process, pushing our teams to experiment and improve. And How It Works lets the design and user experience folks share insights into how we best serve our customers at all levels of the organization. We'll talk about the benefits discovered and challenges faced as we've run those groups for years.\n\nBut pulling those groups together is only one part of the puzzle. Letting the front line see a better future is worthless unless you also make sure they have the room to experiment and the power to prioritize change. We'll talk about how you make that space and build the trust necessary for that to happen.\n\nFinally we'll switch from the large scale to the small, and look at simple things your team can start doing now to build a better culture. Agile will be mentioned, but so will team lunches and board games and communication styles. We'll think about what kind of team you want to build and how you get there.\n\nBecause ultimately, the goal of culture is to make everyone happier: the stakeholders, the executives, the customers, and the teams themselves.",

My experience at the UCSF School of Pharmacy during the pivotal transformation of the PharmD curriculum has opened up the opportunity for great change. This paradigm shift has granted us the ability to reshape the traditional infrastructure by directly influencing how our students learn and how our educators teach. This session will provide an interactive chronicle of the emergence and continuing evolution of instructional design and multimedia in the PharmD curriculum. It will address the development of new ID services and implementation of various technological tools.",

        "description": "UC San Diego launched a web application, Enrollment Authorization System (EASy) for students, staff and faculty to streamline the process of requesting and granting authorization to enroll in classes.  The system facilitates the enrollment authorization workflow communication between students, instructors, undergraduate colleges and department advisors, Graduate Division, medical and professional schools, the International Center, and Summer Session.  EASy’s functions include: exceptions to course prerequisites, enrollment exceptions, late adds, drops, changes to grading options and number of units earned, bypassing restrictions, instructor approvals, batch additions of authorizations to the campus mainframe, data analysis for staff, and more. \n\nThe requests are routed through an appropriate workflow, and some features are customizable per department policies.  Approvals are automatically updated in the mainframe to allow for real time action.  This saves time and increases efficiency for staff, faculty, and students.  Users can track request status and are notified via emails once a decision has been made on the request\n\nAs a student-facing system, EASy has a mobile-friendly interface, to make it as convenient as possible for students to submit and check on their requests from their smartphones.\n\nEASy was the first campus system to use Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to not only access real-time information from the campus mainframe, but to also update it.  This was a huge step for web application efforts, which have traditionally relied upon the campus data warehouse for information, which is refreshed nightly, and can’t be updated by web applications. Through the collaborative efforts of central campus developers at Information Technology Services, the APIs allowed EASy to become a robust system, capable of making real-time updates to the campus mainframe.",

Much of the software our higher education enterprises depend on assumes a more static and unchanging platformsthan the cloud provides. How then do we bring legacy macroservices into these highly dynamic environments?\n\nThis talk focuses on how UCSC has refocused its Systems Engineering teams away from delivering individual servers, and towards building infrastructure code that reliably produces flexible, secure and stable cloud platform environments. If building and delivering a set of servers is “pounding a nail”, delivering a set of well-tested and consistent infrastructure templates and configuration management code is “building a hammer”. We are now in the business of forging hammers.\n\n\\]Much of this talk will, by necessity be specific to AWS, but conceptually it can be easily applied to any cloud service provider.",

        "description": "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European law that UC must adhere to. GDPR has numerous requirements for data privacy and security, many of which impact requirements for systems and applications. Developers and system integrators need to understand what the GDPR regulations are, and what they must do to comply. Failure to comply is not an option. Accordingly, security and privacy features must be developed to meet GDPR requirements. Some of those requirements, such as the _right of erasure_, are technically challenging. Others, including notice and consent requirements, are straightforward.\n\nThis is an introduction for developers and integrators; no code snippets or systems architectures will be discussed during this session.",

It will then illustrate the practical operation of an immersive visualization facility based on concrete examples of scientific research that were made possible through KeckCAVES methods and software. The session will conclude with an overview of the newly re-emerging commercial VR market, and the effect of the availability of cheap VR headsets on sustaining the proven KeckCAVES model of supporting research.",

Upon senior leadership approval of each portfolio, Hampton oversees the project managers to ensure successful implementation of each.\r\n\r\nAlthough several of these initiatives will improve inter-departmental workflow, quality and communication, delivering greater value to the organization, $20 million in new, annual funding (revenue and savings) is forecast by June, 2023.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly a decade that involved living in Europe twice, working for high-tech entrepreneurial start-ups in San Francisco and teaching, Hampton fulfilled one of his life’s goals of working for a higher education institution when he accepted a job at UC Davis in 2005.  After leading teams of IT professionals and Project Managers for several years, Hampton was fortunate to be offered a unique position aimed at driving organization-wide change initiatives which has evolved into his current role, as stated above.

        "description": "Admit it: You have a certain way that you like to do things. Guess what? So does everyone else! In the foundational development program, “People Skills,” individuals develop an increased awareness of the impact that their behavior has on others, enabling them to strengthen relationships, improve communications, and modify their behavior in order to better work with and understand others. This session will provide an introduction to the program and give participants a chance to learn about their own styles.  \n\nPeople Skills is a foundational development program that helps build productive organizations. The program increases awareness of our preferred style of behavior, or “behavior style,” which is perceived by others and impacts them in a positive or negative way. People Skills also increases awareness of how we see others. By observing the behavior of others, we can learn to recognize distinctive traits of a specific behavior style and modify our behavior towards that style accordingly. When we implement these behavior modifications and meet each other’s behavior style needs, we have better access to the talents, skills, and expertise of others. This builds trust and respect, allowing for better communication and collaboration throughout individual, team, and organizational relationships. \n\nBalancing technical expertise with “people skills” is challenging but essential to the success. This incredibly beneficial program provides a mechanism through which this balance can be achieved.",

SEDS built upon a web application that was developed by UCSF School of Medicine in 2006. The key principles maintained through development were to leave the majority of functionality intact and to arrive at a shared set of requirements for any enhancements to the system.  \n   \nStarting with a matured application and minimizing differences between schools was essential for multiple reasons. First, this coupled with the use of an offshore development firm, allowed us to reduce development costs--this project would have been financially unfeasible by each individual school. Second, with data needs on the rise, having all professional schools at UCSF on the same platform will allow us to more easily develop a campus-wide Education Data Warehouse.  \n   \nThis presentation will cover the project from inception through development and into implementation. We will explore the business drivers, gap analysis, funding, shared requirements gathering, and development approach, and the potential future implications of a successful collaboration.",

        "description": "Change Management was spending most of their time following up on change requests lacking basic data. We will walk through our journey to improved CR data quality: process, tool updates, training, etc., while incorporating lean and agile methodologies.\n\nGoal: Decrease follow up (both before and after the change implementation from 88% to 25% by April 2018\n\nWhy: Improve quality of change request data, faster approvals, more efficient use of everyone’s time\n\nJourney:\n\nOur journey started with our department incorporating the ‘4 Disciplines of Execution’ as a framework for identifying and acting on our goals. \n\nThe strategy for the Change team was to identify one goal, a wildly important goal that would change how we do our work and reduce waste.   It had to be a goal that everyone could support and commit to doing, even in the face of our daily whirlwind.  It also had to be measurable.\n\nWe decided to look at the number of RFCs (request for changes) created each week, compared to the number of email follow ups. \n\nHow did we start?: \n\nEach Friday we would review all of the changes for the upcoming weekly change/CAB meeting.  If a change request needed additional information, we would send an email to the user and mark the change request as ‘Additionally Follow-up’ required (check box).  On the following week, we would gather metrics showing the number of change requests opened compared to the number requiring follow-up. We utilized a weekly stand up meeting to discuss weekly commitments and status.\n\nWhat we did:\n\n*   CM team identified several areas for improvements for change process and/or ServiceNow workflow\n\nLow Hanging Fruit:\n\n*   CM Refresher (training) sessions to review the process and how to open a change ticket\n*   Promoted the use of ServiceNow change templates, pre-populated with ticket information\n*   Offered consultative sessions to specific groups or individuals\n*   Working with SN Admin, applied simple changes to ServiceNow to help users, such as editing labels (save, save/exit) ,  extended deadline to submit changes from Thursday to Friday for approval\n*   Survey – Sent a survey to our users asking for their feedback on things they would like to improve or modify for Change Management.  \n*   Value Stream Map used to identify current and future process, reduce wasteful steps  \n    \n\n*   ServiceNow Change Workflow Enhancement –\n\n*   Return to OOB functionality, enables us to utilize SN features, functionality in current and future releases\n    *   Added copy change\n    *   Risk and Impact Assessment\n    *   Phases (chevron) displayed on change form\n*   Agile: SN Developer met with us frequently, making small frequent code changes  \n    \n\n*   CM Team Training:\n\n*   Lean: CM team went through Lean Yellow-belt training, learning how to reduce waste\n*   Agile: CM team, will go through formal team training soon\n\nWhere we are today:\n\nOur journey has been quite rewarding.  We completed our goal:  Less than 25% of our RFCs require additional follow up by CM.  Our users are more empowered and providing more data in their tickets which makes our reviews faster and more efficient.    We are looking forward to next year for continued improvements.",

        "description": "As part of the UC system wide Cyber Security Initiative, UCOP Information Technology Services partnered with each campus and the UC Production Control Shared Services Center (PCSSC) to migrate all UCOP file transfers off the existing UCOP server. The project goal is to improve the security of our UC data being exchanged between the campuses and UCOP, by improving the credentials used, protecting data-in-motion, protecting data-at-rest, improving management and monitoring of data exchanges. The session describes new enterprise level technology solution used for secure file transfers between UCOP ITS, PCSSC and UC Davis various departments.\n\nUC Davis Informational and Education Technology, Enterprise Infrastructure Services organization was tasked to migrate all UC Davis file transfers off the old UCOP server. Project requirements were for every campus to have a single location for the files to be delivered from PCSSC. PCSSC delivers files to a single campus server and campus is responsible for any additional file moves.\n\nThe first task was to provide a location for the files that UC Davis would send and receive from UCOP. Most departments used FTP or SFTP servers to exchange critical files with UCOP, and others dropped/picked up files directly from UCOP servers. Unfortunately, these servers could have become a primary target for hackers as some of the departments used unsecure methods. The next challenge was to find the owners of department files and in some cases transition departmental business process flows to a new process and new tool.\n\nUC Production Control Shared Services Center (PCSSC) is using GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer (MFT) solution. GoAnywhere MFT is an enterprise-level solution that secures, automates, and streamlines file transfers for organizations of all sizes. UC Davis IET is using Go Anywhere MFT as a single point of control to streamline manual processes used by departments to encrypt, compress, monitor and audit file transfers.\n\nUsing the new file transfer enterprise solution, UC Davis had to migrate from an old file transfer mechanism for numerous critical files from various departments like Finance, Undergraduate Admission, Graduate Studies, Budget and Institutional Analysis, Financial Aid and Scholarships, Office of Research, Office of Registrar, UC Davis Health, and others. The new robust, scalable, and secure solution allows new customers to get on board like Student Housing department that is using solution now to transfer payroll files to UCOP.\n\nThe new file transfer mechanism service offered by UC Davis IET allows UC Davis Departments to access, share, and collaborate on multiple files with UCOP and other UC campuses in a secure and protected manner.",

        "description": "The UCSF Precision Medicine effort and the research enterprise need to obtain consent from patients in order to use remnant blood and biological specimens for research. Patients are often happy to consent, but the process is often bogged down by reliance on old-fashioned pen and paper forms that are difficult to scale up.\n\nIn 2017, using intelligence garnered from a successful implementation at UCLA, UCSF's CTSI research technology team implemented a brand new process for UCSF: an iPad-delivered patient education video and electronic consent form for patients waiting in clinics for a blood draw. Developing the process was challenging because of three key requirements: electronic data capture, embedding educational video within the workflow, and secure real time identity verification using UCSF's electronic medical record.\n\nUCSF is quite different from UCLA and we found that while we could learn from the UCLA implementation, we could not simply duplicate their model. While both institutions chose iPads as the data collection device, UCSF did not have a biospecimen technology partner/vendor like UCLA. We did know however, that the HIPAA compliant Qualtrics research platform allowed for building elegant user-friendly surveys and could be configured to embed video within the survey workflow. Qualtrics surveys can work on tablets, but we needed a strictly controlled workflow limited to just one task — completing the consent form. For this, we needed a kiosk app that would turn an iPad into a kiosk, and we found the KioskPro software. We made our Qualtrics survey talk to our electronic medical record (EMR) via the Epic Interconnect API, by solving a tricky technical puzzle (and pioneering a technique that can be reused by other Qualtrics surveys). (Epic is the most widely used EMR system in the US and is implemented at the 5 UC campuses that do research in health sciences: UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Los Angeles, UC San Diego, UC San Francisco.)\n\nThe final solution is technically and visually elegant, has received positive feedback from patients, and has already enabled the collection of dozens of patient research consents. The system was built in about 3 months and involved only part-time effort from two of our team members. An alternative custom app for implementing the same workflow would cost UCSF at least $50,000.\n\nIn this session, we will walk you through the key steps and nuances of setting up a tablet-based kiosk that features a video, enables secure data capture from patients, and integrates with the UCSF clinical systems.",

Are you an app admin who has to put out fires every day because of fragile software? Anyone can write code which gets the job done, but there are a lot of different things that go into making a robust application. Come get a high level, language independent survey of tips, tools, and techniques that will help you give your customers the best experience possible. We will discuss topics such as testing, isolation, monitoring, and code structure. Robust applications take the entire IT team’s involvement, but this will save valuable time and resources later. Stop putting out fires; build robust apps instead.",

        "description": "Coaching to Quell Lingering Resistance in the Wake of Change\n\nThe change has been implemented. Perhaps it is a university or system wide change that has been rolled out with presentations, workshops, staff meetings. Or maybe the change focused on a particular unit. While the change has physically occurred, not everyone is on board with the new program. Resistance may be overt and/or covert. You sense an underlying hope of too many people that this change will go the way of some earlier changes…nowhere...\n\nIn this 45-minute interactive presentation, Barrett McBride, PhD, MCC and Jane Harrington, JD, PCC, will address effective coaching techniques that change agents can use in the all-important post-implementation stage of change.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\n· Definition of Change Resistance Coaching and why it is powerful in the post-implementation phase of change\n\n· Understanding of root causes of change resistance beyond the conventional\n\n· Coaching techniques that create awareness and crack resistance",

The features and functionality of the Windows operating system and applications provide a rich user experience but along with the usability benefits comes privacy trade-offs and forensic evidence for security investigations.\n\nThese artifacts are useful in digital forensic and incident response investigations as well as understanding how humans interact with compromised machines. This presentation will include a technical demonstration of a number of these the usage pattern artifacts while discussing the security and privacy implications.\n\nWithin the structure of the session we will introduce the purpose of the enhanced user experience functionality, how this information is stored within the Windows OS and applications, and then how we can leverage that information to determine what occurred on a computer which can be used for the benefit or detriment of the system user.\n\nThe presentation will tie together this analysis of the applications and operating system interaction to correlate that information with timeline analysis providing a documented picture of what happened on a computer, days, months and in some cases, years later.",

        "description": "Description:  \nThis session looks at an active project at UC San Diego that has developed into:\n\n*   A collaborative project between central campus UC San Diego Research IT Services and UC San Diego Health\n*   A secure environment framework for research in the cloud that is reusable and can be applied at other institutions with organizational decision and security tooling\n\nUC San Diego is actively developing a protected data environment in the cloud.  This effort is ongoing, and includes investigation and development of the NIST 800-53 Security Controls, regulatory requirements, and associated documentation required for a compliant environment. Associated with this is a pilot project with actual researchers, currently with de-identified data in the cloud, with the intent of moving protected data into the environment when available/approved. In addition, a proof of concept will investigate feasibility and cost estimations of a proposed production cloud-hosted protected data environment service for local researchers and their collaborators. In this session, we will show a best practice, 3-layer application stack (with the integrated security layering), data storage options, and some of the organizational decisions that would need to be made to adopt this framework  \n   \nDetail:  \nThe presentation will cover:\n\n*   Collaborative development of a secure environment framework for research in the cloud\n*   Use of AWS\n*   Security controls\n*   Documentation\n\n   \nImpacts:  \nSharing this presentation with the other UC campuses may provide a leg up to jump-start protected data cloud environments for researchers across the UC System.  \n   \nOn the San Diego campus, the aim is to provide an efficient, affordable protected data storage and compute environment, particularly for those researchers on the long tail of research whose grant and departmental/lab resources are limited. By examining a solution centrally, we open up possibilities for extended collaborations, potential to pursue additional funding opportunities, and better compliance and adherence to security recommendations and requirements.  \n   \nFor UC San Diego Health the goal is to provide a service catalog of offerings that extends the capacity, extensibility and flexibility of on-prem offerings.  In addition, getting security approval for allowing/trusting cloud provider with sensitive data will provide a pathway for facilitating a wide array of clinical research avenues in the future.  \n   \nTakeaways  \nThis session will provide an overview of current, ongoing activities in UC San Diego Research IT Services and UC San Diego Health. Through the session, attendees will gain a clear idea of the security controls and documentation necessary to develop and run a compliant AWS environment.",

        "title": "Supporting Active Research Data",
        "description": "The Research Data Management program at UC Berkeley has, for the past three years, provided on-the-ground consulting to researchers from disciplines spanning the campus. Much of the program's effort goes towards what we call “active data” – the files created, collected, processed and analyzed while a study is in progress. Frequently, this equates to terabytes and terabytes of material; or millions of files; or personally identifiable information from surveys, interviews, observations and experiments.\n\nManaging active research data has its own needs and dynamics. Large-scale support solutions are elusive. A good example: free storage offered by cloud providers such as Box and Google Drive. These campus-managed services seem like a simple and cost-effective way to keep data safe from loss and to organize the output of multiple investigations running within a lab. At scale, however, researchers struggle just to move their files to these enterprise offerings. Helping them manage their transfers can entail hours of collaborative effort and greater complexity than the researchers anticipate. In working with principal investigators, lab managers and research assistants, it quickly becomes clear how the demands of time and technical expertise run up against other pressures -- competing obligations and deadlines, limited research funds, and even culture -- to shape a project’s approach and its willingness to engage.\n\nThis talk will focus on the experiences of the Research Data Management consulting team. It will describe the use of tools ranging from FileZilla and Globus to lftp, rclone, Python, *nix shell commands, and Jupyter notebooks, and showcase attempts to craft a broad response to individual data management needs. There will also be time to discuss what strategies and techniques others from around the UC system are developing and using.",

This workshop will foster the development of a Carpentries community across the UC system; we will identify and enable the sharing of resources, materials, and good practices, and will brainstorm future activities to advance Carpentries work at our respective institutions.\n\nThe Carpentries project is a non-profit, volunteer-led organization. It comprises Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry, communities of Instructors, Trainers, Lesson Maintainers, helpers and supporters who share a mission to teach foundational computational and data science skills to researchers. Skills are taught through short, impactful workshops, often targeted to specific research domains. Additional nascent projects include High Performance Computing (HPC) Carpentry and Library Carpentry.\n\nWe will solicit participation from various campuses, both to gather materials (including modules used,  approaches to campus outreach, etc.) in advance, and to identify Carpentries instructors, supporters, and stakeholders. At a minimum, this will provide a cross-section of materials used on each campus; an ideal outcome will connect participants from various campuses to catalyze a system-wide community of Carpentries partners. We are working on a source of funds to subsidize participants who are directly involved in Carpentries efforts, and who may not otherwise have travel funding to attend UCCSC.\n\nOrganizing partners include: Claire Mizumoto (UCSD), Tim Dennis (UCLA) , and Patrick Schmitz (UCB)",

Its focus is to develop informational campaigns, materials, and other resources that all UC locations can use to promote good cybersecurity habits and information security awareness year‐round. The specific goals of this project are to:\n\n1) Provide themed materials and resources that all UC locations can use as‐is or with customization to run information security awareness campaigns year‐round according to a pre‐established systemwide calendar.\n\n2) Develop a repository of information security awareness “toolkits” that UC locations can use whenever they want or need. Locations can pick and choose materials from the toolkits and use them as‐is or customize them according to their needs.\n\n3) Save everyone time and resources, and share broadly.\n\nThis project has been running for almost a year, producing 7 themed information security awareness campaigns. Come learn about this unique, collaborative project.",

To others, paperwork was the person who responded to email when they felt like it. While to some others, it was the manual data-entry into spreadsheets. To us, paperwork was many things, but to me, I knew paperwork as inefficiency.\n\nWith paperwork's departure, we hope to see decreased response time in our correspondence. We hope to see a shared knowledge base of information. We even hope that some day, automated workflows can stand where paperwork failed.\n\nLet's prove to paperwork's legacy, that we can do better.\n\n**Join our session and receive access to _several_ of our ServiceNow enhancements and custom applications.

A sudden increase in phishing pushed our rollout of two-factor authentication for VPN and email up by 6 months, to just before the holiday travel rush. It took a huge effort from many teams and stakeholders to get it done, but we successfully enrolled over 25,000 users in 3 weeks. Our CIO paid us the ultimate compliment, saying it was the quietest go-live he had ever seen. Learn from us just how hard it is to support faculty traveling on 6 continents (especially Africa), why millennials are our new best friends, what a Yubikey is and why you might not want one, and the magical power of cookies in making the project successful.",

        "description": "The Health Stack project at UCSF CDHI (Center for Digital Health Innovation) is deploying a referral solution for Pediatric Access Center (PAC) in April 2018 to improve the efficiency of processing incoming referrals from community clinics, and to provide greater transparency of referral status to referring providers and patients. This includes a Fax-to-Referral web app that a referring coordinator can use to automatically transcribes the contents of a referral fax, map content to their corresponding EHR attributes, and create the referral in the EHR. It also provides a Referral Dashboard that referring providers can securely access to view up-to-date status of their referrals as recorded in the specialist's EHR. This session will provide a demo of the application and the underlying technology architecture and integration points such as using FHIR API's.",

        "description": "Make the most efficient use of your time by enjoying your lunch while you learn about continuous process improvement and how to participate in this growing community! In this two-part session, you’ll learn about Lean Six Sigma and find out how to connect with colleagues to keep the conversation going.\n\nPart 1: “Demystifying Lean Six Sigma” - If you've ever wondered about Lean Six Sigma, but didn't want to ask, we'll break it down for you. In this workshop, you will learn tools and tips from your peers across UCs that can be immediately implemented to improve your work environment.  You'll master the differences between Lean and Six Sigma, how they complement one another and how your skills can grow into a yellow, green or black belt.  Furthermore, you'll join in the conversation on nurturing a culture of continuous improvement within yourself, your team or university. (presentation format)\n\nPart 2: “Business Excellence Community of Practice: Where Business Meets IT” - Peanut butter and Jelly. Bacon and eggs. Business and IT. Some things are just better together! A brand-new Community of Practice brings business and IT together- as they were naturally meant to be. The Business Excellence Community of Practice (BECoP) is a consortium of local practitioners in the areas of Organizational Change Management, Continuous Improvement based on Lean Six Sigma, and Project Management.  We welcome anyone who is excited about bringing positive change to our esteemed network of institutions. Through the exchange of a common language and experiences, we leverage this forum to share tips, best practices, resources, and institutional knowledge to enhance organizational insight, business judgement, and strategic acumen. Come find out how you can join the discussion and be part of this flourishing community! (interactive panel format)\n\nLunch provided at session.",

To that end, he assembles and guides cohorts of campus & system-wide executives and subject-matter experts through a multi-month exploration process aimed at generating multi-million dollar proposals for recurring cost savings/revenue and campus-wide efficiencies. Upon senior leadership approval of each portfolio, Hampton oversees the project managers to ensure successful implementation of each.\r\n\r\nAlthough several of these initiatives will improve inter-departmental workflow, quality and communication, delivering greater value to the organization, $20 million in new, annual funding (revenue and savings) is forecast by June, 2023.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly a decade that involved living in Europe twice, working for high-tech entrepreneurial start-ups in San Francisco and teaching, Hampton fulfilled one of his life’s goals of working for a higher education institution when he accepted a job at UC Davis in 2005.  After leading teams of IT professionals and Project Managers for several years, Hampton was fortunate to be offered a unique position aimed at driving organization-wide change initiatives which has evolved into his current role, as stated above.  Hampton earned his Bachelors from Boston University and his MBA from the University of San Francisco.",
